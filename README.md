# Team-404

Hello , I seperated the code into two folders Client and Server. Server is for the backend and Client for the front end.
All you need to do in the Client folder is just do npm i to download the node_modules folder and then everything should work perfectly.
Check the sprint4 backlog to know your tasks , goodluck :D
